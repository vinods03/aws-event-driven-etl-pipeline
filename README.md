# aws-event-driven-etl-pipeline

Different options for event driven processing in AWS are explored here. We perform reconcilation as well between the landing layer and the staging layer. The idea is to build a robust event driven pipeline. Will be addin a redshift layer to this pipeline and also a notifcation process that will get triggered when there is a count mismatch across the various layers of the ETL pipeline.
