# aws-event-driven-etl-pipeline

Different options for event driven processing in AWS are explored here. We perform reconcilation as well between the landing layer and teh staging layer (count check). The idea is to build a robust event driven pipeline. Will be addin a redshift layer to this pipeline and also a notifcation process that will get triggered when there is a count mismatch across the various layers of teh ETL pipeline.
